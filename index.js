throw new Error(`
megaronk, made to sound like Mega Wrong, is a library meant to tell developers that a company is bad in the Job description.
This library should warn developers from a bad position/workplace by reading in the job description or being asked about it in an interview.
If the recruiters will search and find this library they would probably not jump into the source code and try to run this library. 
Developers out of curiosity will go and search and hopefully test and see this message.
It is just an idea to help developers, please don't get angry at me in the issues section :)
Please don't put this in production
